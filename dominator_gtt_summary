The Dominator GTT performs well for its class, having decent speed, excellent acceleration, great traction and adequete braking. The vehicle is also able to perform drifts 
fairly well. However, the high torque means it may take a while to take off, unless the player slightly presses the accelerator button.

The vehicle features a modeled V8 engine with a single bank of cams on either side of the engine. On the top is a large cylindrical air filter wrapped with red filter paper, 
which can be replaced with either eight ram pipes or a supercharger. It uses a high-revving engine sound, which is an edited variation of the ones from both the Gauntlet 
Classic and the Deviant. The badges indicates that the Dominator GTT is powered by a 450cui (7.4L) Supercharged engine. A 4-speed gearbox and a RWD layout come as standard. 
Similar to vehicles like the Fr√§nken Stange, the Hustler and the Hotring Sabre, the vehicle features fully-animated timing belt and pulleys.
